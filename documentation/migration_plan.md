# Migration Plan: Ruby on Rails to Angular/Spring Boot

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to migrate the Ruby on Rails financial management application to an Angular/Spring Boot stack.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Completed)
- [x] Document the existing Ruby on Rails application structure
- [x] Create entity relationship diagrams
- [x] Design RESTful API structure for the new backend
- [x] Define Angular application architecture
- [x] Create sequence diagrams for core application flows
- [x] Set up project repositories

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### Spring Boot Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - JWT Authentication
  - PostgreSQL/MySQL Connector
  - Lombok
  - ModelMapper/MapStruct
  - Validation
- [ ] Configure application properties for development environment

### Entity Layer Implementation
- [ ] Implement JPA entities from the data model
  - User
  - Category
  - Transfer
  - TransferItem
  - Currency
  - Exchange
  - Conversion
  - Goal
  - Report
- [ ] Set up entity relationships and validations

### Repository Layer Implementation
- [ ] Create Spring Data JPA repositories for all entities
- [ ] Implement custom query methods for complex operations

### Service Layer Implementation
- [ ] Implement service classes with business logic
  - UserService
  - CategoryService
  - TransferService
  - CurrencyService
  - ExchangeService
  - ReportService
- [ ] Implement nested set pattern for category hierarchies
- [ ] Implement balanced transfer validation logic
- [ ] Implement currency conversion calculations

### Security Implementation
- [ ] Configure Spring Security
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Set up user registration and activation process
- [ ] Implement role-based authorization

### REST API Layer Implementation
- [ ] Create REST controllers for all resources
  - AuthController
  - CategoryController
  - TransferController
  - CurrencyController
  - ExchangeController
  - ReportController
  - UserController
- [ ] Implement request/response DTOs
- [ ] Set up entity-DTO mapping
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### Testing Backend
- [ ] Write unit tests for services
- [ ] Write integration tests for repositories
- [ ] Write API tests for controllers
- [ ] Test security and authentication

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Angular Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Angular project with Angular CLI
- [ ] Set up Angular Material or other UI component library
- [ ] Configure routing module
- [ ] Set up core and shared modules

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement authentication service
- [ ] Set up HTTP interceptors for authentication and error handling
- [ ] Create data services for API communication
- [ ] Implement state management (if needed)

### Feature Modules Implementation
- [ ] Implement auth feature (login, register, etc.)
- [ ] Implement dashboard feature
- [ ] Implement categories feature
- [ ] Implement transfers feature
- [ ] Implement currencies feature
- [ ] Implement reports feature
- [ ] Implement user settings feature

### UI Components
- [ ] Create reusable UI components
- [ ] Implement data tables with sorting and filtering
- [ ] Create forms with validation
- [ ] Implement category tree display
- [ ] Build charts for reports and statistics

### Testing Frontend
- [ ] Write unit tests for services and components
- [ ] Write e2e tests for critical workflows

## Phase 4: Integration and Deployment

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend services
- [ ] Test all API integrations
- [ ] Fix cross-origin issues
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures

### Optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for feature modules
- [ ] Optimize API calls with pagination and filtering

### Deployment
- [ ] Configure production build settings
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy backend to production server
- [ ] Deploy frontend to static hosting or CDN

## Phase 5: Data Migration

### Migration Scripts
- [ ] Create database schema migration scripts
- [ ] Implement data transformation and migration scripts
- [ ] Test migration with sample data

### Production Migration
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Back up existing data
- [ ] Execute migration scripts
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Switch to new system

## Phase 6: Post-Migration Support

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanism

### Improvements
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Implement quick fixes for critical issues
- [ ] Plan future enhancements

## Current Status

We are currently in Phase 2, focusing on implementing the Spring Boot backend components. The documentation phase has been completed, providing a clear roadmap for the development process.

## Next Steps

1. Start implementing Spring Boot entities
2. Create repositories and services
3. Develop REST API controllers
4. Begin building the Angular application structure

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Complete
- **Phase 2**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1 week
- **Phase 6**: Ongoing

Total estimated project duration: 11 weeks + ongoing support
