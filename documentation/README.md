# Financial Management Application Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the financial management application, which is currently a Ruby on Rails application planned for reengineering to an Angular and Node.js stack.

## Documentation Contents

1. [Current State Data Model](./current_state_data_model.md) - Describes the current data model of the application
2. [Application Workflow](./application_workflow.md) - Outlines the key workflows and interactions in the application
3. [Code Architecture](./code_architecture.md) - Explains the current code architecture and patterns
4. [Reengineering Recommendations](./reengineering_recommendations.md) - Provides guidance for migrating to Angular and Node.js

## Project Overview

The Financial Management Application is a comprehensive tool that allows users to:

- Track income, expenses, assets, and loans
- Work with multiple currencies and exchange rates
- Organize financial data in hierarchical categories
- Set and track financial goals
- Generate various types of financial reports
- Visualize financial data through charts and graphs

The application is currently implemented in Ruby on Rails, with future plans to migrate to an Angular frontend with a Node.js backend.

## Key Features

- Hierarchical categories using nested set pattern
- Complex multi-currency support
- Advanced financial reporting
- Goal tracking
- User authentication and authorization
- Data visualization

## Documentation Purpose

This documentation is intended to facilitate:

1. Understanding of the current application structure
2. Planning for the migration to Angular and Node.js
3. Preservation of critical business functionality during migration
4. Implementation of best practices in the new technology stack

The documents in this folder provide a foundation for the reengineering effort and should be updated as the project progresses.
