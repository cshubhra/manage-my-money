# Financial Management System - Application Migration

This documentation describes the migration of the Ruby on Rails financial management application to Angular and Spring Boot.

## Overview

The original application is a personal finance management system built with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to:

1. Track income and expenses across multiple categories
2. Manage multiple currencies and exchange rates
3. Create financial goals
4. Generate reports on spending and financial status
5. Track loans and debts

The new application will maintain the same functionality but will be built using:

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Java
- **API**: RESTful services
