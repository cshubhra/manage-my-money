# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the migration from Ruby on Rails to Angular and Spring Boot.

## Testing Objectives

1. Ensure functional equivalence between the old and new systems
2. Validate all business logic is correctly implemented
3. Verify that the user experience remains consistent or improves
4. Confirm that performance meets or exceeds original application
5. Ensure security of the new implementation

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing

Tests to verify that the system functions according to requirements.

#### Backend API Tests
- CRUD operations on all entities
- Business logic validation
- Error handling
- Edge cases

#### Frontend Component Tests
- UI rendering correctness
- Form validations
- User interactions
- Error displays

### Regression Testing

Tests to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.

- Automated regression test suite covering critical paths
- Regular execution on each milestone completion
- Visual regression testing for UI components

### Performance Testing

Tests to ensure the application meets performance requirements.

#### Backend Performance
- **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling
- **Tests**:
  - API endpoint response times
  - Database query performance
  - Throughput under load
  - Memory usage monitoring

#### Frontend Performance
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Tests**:
  - Page load time
  - Time to interactive
  - First contentful paint
  - Bundle size analysis

### Security Testing

Tests to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube
- **Tests**:
  - Authentication/Authorization testing
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - SQL injection prevention
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
  - CSRF protection
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Accessibility Testing

Tests to ensure the application is accessible to all users.

- **Tools**: axe, Lighthouse
- **Tests**:
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Color contrast
  - ARIA attributes
  - Focus management

## Test Environments

### Development
- Local environment for developers
- Unit and basic integration tests
- Immediate feedback on changes

### Test/QA
- Integrated test environment
- Full integration and E2E testing
- Manual exploratory testing
- Performance testing

### Staging
- Production-like environment
- User acceptance testing
- Final regression testing before production
- Load and security testing

## Test Data Management

### Approach
- Use of test factories for generating test data
- Database seeding scripts for consistent test datasets
- Anonymized production data for realistic testing scenarios
- Data cleanup procedures after test execution

### Data Sets
- Minimal dataset for basic functionality testing
- Comprehensive dataset for complex scenarios
- Large volume dataset for performance testing

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

### CI Pipeline
- Automated execution of unit and integration tests on each commit
- Static code analysis with SonarQube
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code coverage reporting

### CD Pipeline
- Deployment to test environment after successful CI pipeline
- Automated smoke tests after deployment
- Manual approval for staging/production deployments
- Rollback procedures in case of test failures

## Test Automation Strategy

### Automation Criteria
- Tests that need to run frequently
- Critical path functionality
- Regression-prone areas
- Time-consuming manual tests

### Non-Automated Testing
- Exploratory testing
- Usability testing
- Complex edge cases
- One-time migration validations

## Test Documentation

### Test Plans
- Overall test strategy (this document)
- Specific test plans for major features
- Test case specifications for critical functionality

### Test Reports
- Automated test execution reports
- Test coverage reports
- Bug reports and resolution tracking
- Release readiness reports

## Bug Tracking and Management

### Process
1. Bug identification and documentation
2. Severity and priority classification
3. Assignment and resolution
4. Verification and closure

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality broken, no workaround
- **Medium**: Feature partially broken, workaround exists
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

## Specific Test Cases for Key Functionality

### User Authentication
- User registration with valid inputs
- Login with correct credentials
- Login with incorrect credentials
- Password reset functionality
- Account activation process
- Session timeout handling
- Remember me functionality

### Category Management
- Creating categories with valid inputs
- Creating nested subcategories
- Moving categories in hierarchy
- Calculating category balances
- Category permissions
- Category deletion with transfers

### Transfer Management
- Creating balanced transfers
- Multi-currency transfers
- Transfer validation
- Transfer editing
- Transfer search and filtering
- Quick transfer creation

### Currency and Exchange
- Adding new currencies
- Setting exchange rates
- Converting between currencies
