# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Financial Management System migration from Ruby on Rails to Angular and Spring Boot.

## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of the testing strategy are:

1. Ensure feature parity with the original Ruby on Rails application
2. Validate data integrity during and after migration
3. Verify correct implementation of business rules and calculations
4. Ensure performance meets or exceeds the original application
5. Validate security of the new implementation

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical:** System crash, data loss, security breach
- **Major:** Function unusable, workaround difficult
- **Minor:** Function partially impaired, workaround available
- **Cosmetic:** UI issues, typos, non-functional defects
