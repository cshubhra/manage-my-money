# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the Ruby on Rails financial management application to Angular and Spring Boot.

## Migration Approach

We'll use a phased approach that minimizes risk while ensuring the new system maintains complete feature parity with the original:

1. **Analysis & Planning**
   - Document existing features and data model
   - Create comprehensive tests to ensure feature parity
   - Design new architecture and data model

2. **Backend Development**
   - Start with Spring Boot backend development
   - Implement REST APIs that mirror the current functionality
   - Set up comprehensive integration tests

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Develop Angular frontend in parallel with backend
   - Implement components matching the current user experience
   - Integrate with backend services as they become available

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Perform comprehensive testing of the full application
   - Refine frontend and backend as needed
   - Performance testing and optimization

5. **Data Migration & Deployment**
   - Create data migration scripts
   - Deploy and validate in staging environment
   - Go live with production deployment

## Data Migration Plan

Data migration will be performed using a combination of ETL tools and custom scripts:

1. **Export Current Data**
   - Dump Ruby on Rails database to JSON format
   - Validate data integrity in the export

2. **Transform Data**
   - Use custom scripts to transform data to the new schema
   - Handle any necessary data conversions

3. **Load Data**
   - Import transformed data to the new database
   - Verify data integrity after import
   - Run validation tests to ensure business rules are maintained

4. **Validate Migration**
   - Compare record counts between old and new systems
   - Check sample records for accuracy
   - Run business-level validation checks

## Key Data Model Changes

### Ruby on Rails to Spring Boot

| Rails Model       | Spring Boot Entity   | Key Changes                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `User`            | `User`                | Enhanced security model with JWT integration    |
| `Category`        | `Category`            | Simplified tree structure with JPA annotations  |
| `Transfer`        | `Transfer`            | Improved transaction handling                   |
| `TransferItem`    | `TransferItem`        | Optimized for financial calculations            |
| `Currency`        | `Currency`            | Added ISO standard compliance                   |
| `Exchange`        | `Exchange`            | Enhanced for better rate history                |
| `Goal`            | `Goal`                | Expanded tracking capabilities                  |
| `Report`          | `Report`              | More flexible reporting engine                  |
| `SystemCategory`  | `SystemCategory`      | Simplified category templates                   |

## Feature Migration Plan

We'll migrate features in the following order to ensure core functionality is available early:

1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - User registration, login, profile
   - Security and authorization

2. **Core Financial Data**
   - Categories (nested structure)
   - Currencies and exchange rates
   - Basic transfers

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Reports and data visualization
   - Goals and tracking
   - Loan management

4. **System Features**
   - Import/Export
   - System categories
   - User preferences

## Compatibility Considerations

1. **URL Structure**
   - Create redirects for common bookmarked pages
   - Maintain similar routing patterns where possible

2. **Browser Support**
   - Ensure support for the same browsers as the original application
   - Add support for newer browsers

3. **Mobile Support**
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness in the new Angular frontend
   - Test thoroughly on various devices

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Feature Parity**
   - Comprehensive feature testing between old and new systems
   - User acceptance testing with current system users

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Multiple validation checkpoints during data migration
   - Ability to rollback changes if issues are detected

3. **Performance**
   - Performance testing under various load conditions
   - Optimization of slow operations identified in current system

4. **User Adoption**
   - Maintain similar UX patterns where they work well
   - Provide user documentation for new features and changes

## Implementation Timeline

The migration will be completed in phases over a period of 3-4 months:

1. **Month 1**: Analysis, architecture design, and backend foundation
2. **Month 2**: Core backend APIs and frontend foundation
3. **Month 3**: Complete feature implementation and integration
4. **Month 4**: Testing, refinement, and deployment
