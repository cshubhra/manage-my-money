# Implementation Timeline

This document outlines the timeline for implementing the migration from Ruby on Rails to Angular and Spring Boot.

## Overview

The implementation is divided into four major phases, spanning approximately 16 weeks (4 months):

1. **Analysis & Planning** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Backend Development** (Weeks 3-8)
3. **Frontend Development** (Weeks 5-12)
4. **Integration, Testing & Deployment** (Weeks 13-16)

Note that backend and frontend development will overlap, with frontend work beginning once the core backend APIs are established.
