# Modernization Challenges and Risk Analysis

## 1. Complex Business Logic Migration

### 1.1 Category Tree Management
```ruby
# Current implementation uses acts_as_nested_set for hierarchical data
acts_as_nested_set :scope=> [:user_id, :category_type_int]
```

**Challenges:**
- Spring Boot implementation needs hierarchical data management
- Complex category movement operations
- Tree structure maintenance
- Performance optimization for deep hierarchies

**Solutions:**
- Implement Nested Set pattern in Spring JPA
- Use Materialized Path for tree operations
- Consider using recursive CTE for PostgreSQL queries
- Implement caching for frequently accessed tree structures

### 1.2 Multi-Currency Support

**Current Features:**
- Dynamic currency conversion
- Historical exchange rates
- Multiple calculation algorithms
- Complex saldo calculations

**Migration Challenges:**
- Maintaining calculation accuracy
- Currency conversion precision
- Historical rate tracking
- Performance optimization

**Solutions:**
- Use BigDecimal for all monetary calculations
- Implement Money pattern with Currency
- Create dedicated Exchange Rate service
- Cache exchange rates strategically

### 1.3 Report Generation

**Complex Calculations:**
```ruby
def calculate_share_values(depth, period_start, period_end)
  # Complex hierarchical calculations
  # Period-based aggregations
  # Multi-currency conversions
end
```

**Challenges:**
- Complex aggregation logic
- Performance with large datasets
- Multi-currency report generation
- Hierarchical data presentation

**Solutions:**
- Implement report generation as background jobs
- Use Spring Batch for large datasets
- Create materialized views for common reports
- Implement caching strategy for report results

- Exchange rate history
- User preferences and settings

### 2.3 Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1: Schema Migration**
   - Create new Spring Boot compatible schema
   - Map existing relationships
   - Set up new indices and constraints

2. **Phase 2: Data Migration**
   - Implement data validation
   - Create data transformation scripts
   - Test data integrity
   - Perform incremental migration

3. **Phase 3: Verification**
   - Balance validation
   - Category structure validation
   - Historical report verification
   - User settings confirmation

## 3. Technical Architecture Challenges

### 3.1 Authentication System Migration
**Current System:**
```ruby
include Authentication
include Authentication::ByPassword
include Authentication::ByCookieToken
```

**Migration Needs:**
- JWT implementation
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password security upgrade

### 3.2 Frontend State Management
**Current State:**
- Server-side rendered views
- jQuery-based interactions
- Direct DOM manipulation

**Target State:**
- NgRx state management
- Component-based architecture
- Reactive forms
- Real-time updates

### 3.3 API Performance
**Challenges:**
- N+1 query elimination
- Optimized data loading
- Caching strategy
- Real-time updates

**Solutions:**
- Implement GraphQL for complex queries
- Use JPA EntityGraph for eager loading
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- WebSocket for real-time updates
