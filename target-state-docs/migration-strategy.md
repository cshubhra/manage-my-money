# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach for migrating from the current Ruby on Rails application to the target Angular and Node.js architecture.

## Migration Overview

The migration from the Ruby on Rails monolith to an Angular frontend with a Node.js REST API backend requires careful planning to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to users. This document outlines the strategy, approach, and key considerations for this migration.

## Migration Approaches

We will use a phased migration approach combining the following strategies:

## Technical Approach Details

### API Layer Strategy

The API layer will be the bridge between the old and new systems, enabling gradual migration:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Client Applications] --> API[API Gateway]
    
    API --> NewAPI[New Node.js API]
    API --> LegacyAPI[Legacy Rails API]
    
    NewAPI --> DB[(Shared Database)]
    LegacyAPI --> DB
    
    subgraph "Phase 1"
        Client
        API
        LegacyAPI
        DB
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 2"
        Client
        API
        NewAPI
        LegacyAPI
        DB
    end
    
    subgraph "Final Phase"
        Client
        NewAPI
        DB
    end
```

1. **API First Development**
   - Design comprehensive API contract before implementation
   - Use OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation and code generation
   - Implement API versioning from the start
   - Create API tests before implementing endpoints

2. **Authentication Migration**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication in the new system
   - Create auth bridge between old and new systems during transition
   - Migrate user credentials securely with proper hashing

3. **Progressive API Replacement**
   - Replace API endpoints one domain at a time
   - Start with read-only endpoints, then add write operations
   - Use feature flags to control which system handles each endpoint
   - Monitor performance and errors closely during transition

### Database Migration

The database migration will follow these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    RailsDB[Rails Database Schema] --> Analysis[Schema Analysis]
    Analysis --> NewSchema[Node.js TypeORM Schema]
    
    RailsDB --> Extract[Data Extraction]
    NewSchema --> Transform[Data Transformation]
    Transform --> Load[Data Loading]
    Extract --> Transform
    
    Load --> NewDB[New Database]
    
    RailsDB --> Sync[Synchronization Mechanism]
    Sync --> NewDB
```

1. **Schema Migration**
   - Map Rails ActiveRecord models to TypeORM entities
   - Handle complex relationships and inheritance
   - Implement appropriate indexes and constraints
   - Consider performance optimizations in new schema

2. **Data Migration Tools**
   - Develop custom ETL scripts for data migration
   - Handle data transformations and normalization
   - Implement validation and error handling
   - Create rollback capabilities

3. **Data Synchronization During Transition**
   - Implement bidirectional sync during parallel operation
   - Use database triggers or change data capture
   - Create conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Monitor synchronization performance and fix issues

### Frontend Migration

The frontend migration will follow this approach:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Rails[Rails Views] --> Analysis[Component Analysis]
    Analysis --> Design[UI/UX Redesign]
    Design --> Components[Angular Components]
    
    Components --> CoreUI[Core UI Framework]
    Components --> Features[Feature Modules]
    
    CoreUI --> Shell[Application Shell]
    Features --> Domain[Domain-Specific Components]
```

1. **Component-Based Migration**
   - Break UI into discrete components with clear responsibilities
   - Map Rails views to Angular components
   - Improve UX during redesign process
   - Create component library for consistency

2. **State Management**
   - Implement NgRx for global state management
   - Define clear state models and selectors
   - Create effects for handling side effects
   - Implement robust error handling

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with core user flows
   - Add features incrementally
   - Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Implement accessibility features throughout

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | High | Multiple test runs, comprehensive backups, thorough validation |
| Performance issues in new system | Medium | High | Performance testing early, optimization, scalable architecture |
| User adaptation challenges | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive training, familiar UI patterns, phased rollout |
| Integration issues with third-party systems | Medium | Medium | Early integration testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Timeline delays | High | Medium | Buffer in schedule, prioritized features, MVP approach |
| Technical debt from rushed implementation | Medium | High | Strong code review process, automated testing, clear standards |

### Rollback Strategy

In case of critical issues post-migration:

1. **Partial Rollback**
   - Ability to route traffic back to the old system for specific features
   - Keep old system running until new system is stable
   - Implement feature flags to disable problematic areas

2. **Complete Rollback**
   - Maintain complete backup of original system and data
   - Document detailed rollback procedures
   - Test rollback process before actual migration
   - Create communication plan for users in case of rollback

3. **Data Recovery**
   - Implement point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - Maintain transaction logs during migration
   - Create data reconciliation tools

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All features from the original system are implemented
   - New features planned for the target system are working
   - No critical functionality is missing

2. **Technical Success**
   - System meets performance benchmarks
   - Code quality metrics meet or exceed standards
   - Test coverage meets target thresholds

3. **User Acceptance**
   - User satisfaction metrics meet targets
   - Training is completed successfully
   - Support tickets related to migration are within acceptable limits

4. **Business Impact**
   - No significant disruption to business operations
   - Maintenance costs are reduced
   - New feature development velocity increases
